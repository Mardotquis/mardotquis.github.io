                    <figcaption className="aboutme__paragraph">Welcome! My name is Marquis Laron Mitchell and I am a young motivated individual who is extremely passionate about technology and innovation. Growing up in Charlotte, N.C., I am a city-boy at heart who fell in love with tech at a very young age. Iâ€™ve literally had my career path set on technology since I was about nine years old and always knew that one day I would be working with it, doing something I love! I attended Phillip O. Berry Academy of Technology where I participated in the Engineering Academy and received my NAF diploma along with my high school diploma. </figcaption>
                    <p className="aboutme__paragraph bottom">Recently, I participated in the Road to Hire program at Red Ventures that has taught me the basics of web development and helped me jump start my career. <span className="important-bold">In about five months, I went from zero coding experience to being able to build full-stack web applications using modern technologies.</span> After Road to Hire, I was blessed with the opportunity to join Red Ventures as a Software Engineer and can't wait to see where my new career takes me. Thanks for visiting my portfolio and welcome to my journey!</p>
